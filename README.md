# 🌿 HealthyAir  
**Smart Air Quality Monitoring & Health Risk Detection System**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
HealthyAir is a data-driven web application that analyzes air pollution data across locations and time. The goal is to transform complex air quality datasets into simple and actionable insights so citizens can understand pollution trends and make better health decisions.

This project focuses on identifying pollution hotspots, detecting long-term trends, and predicting health risk levels using data science and machine learning.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Although governments release open air quality data, it is often difficult for the public to interpret. Raw datasets do not clearly highlight trends, high-risk periods, or regional comparisons. As a result, people are unable to take preventive actions to protect their health.

HealthyAir converts raw pollution data into meaningful visual insights and risk predictions through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Solution  
HealthyAir uses data science techniques to:
- Analyze air pollution trends over time  
- Identify pollution hotspots  
- Compare air quality across locations  
- Detect high-risk periods  
- Predict pollution risk levels  
- Provide clear visual dashboards

## 🧠 Learning Milestone 1: Data Science Lifecycle (Question → Data → Insight)

This project follows a structured **Data Science Lifecycle** approach before building models.

### 1️⃣ From Curiosity to a Clear Question  
A strong project begins with a meaningful question.

**Key Question:**  
How can we identify pollution hotspots, long-term trends, and high-risk periods using historical air quality data?

---

### 2️⃣ Understanding Data as Evidence  
Air quality data may contain:
- Missing values  
- Sensor errors  
- Inconsistencies  
- Bias due to monitoring systems  

We focus on understanding the dataset before using it.

---

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis  
We explore patterns, trends, and anomalies to understand pollution behavior.

---

### 4️⃣ Turning Observations into Insights  
Insights help decision-making by connecting data patterns to health and environmental impact.

---

### 5️⃣ Importance  
This lifecycle ensures alignment between the problem, data, and solution.

## 🧠 Learning Milestone 2: Reading & Interpreting a Data Science Repository  

Before contributing to a project, it is important to understand how the repository is structured and how different parts of the workflow connect.

This milestone helps in developing the ability to read a repository with intention and clarity.

---

### ✅ 1. A Repository Is a Story  
A data science repository is not just a collection of files. It represents the journey from problem to insight.

While reviewing repositories, we focus on:
- Understanding the problem  
- Identifying the approach  
- Recognizing completed and pending work  
- Understanding assumptions and decisions  

---

### ✅ 2. Understanding the README  
The README acts as the entry point and guide to the project.

We evaluate:
- Clarity of the problem statement  
- Dataset sources and description  
- Workflow and methodology  
- Key results and insights  
- Instructions for usage  

We also identify missing or unclear documentation.

---

### ✅ 3. Folder Structure Interpretation  
Common folders in data science projects include:

- `data/` → Raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` → Exploration and analysis  
- `src/` or `scripts/` → Reusable code  
- `models/` → Saved models  
- `reports/` or `figures/` → Visual outputs  

This helps us:
- Understand each stage of the lifecycle  
- Distinguish between experimentation and production work  
- Identify where contributions should be made  

---

### ✅ 4. Reading Notebooks with Purpose  
Instead of focusing on every line of code, we:
- Understand the goal of each notebook  
- Identify data loading and preprocessing steps  
- Recognize exploratory vs final analysis  
- Follow the reasoning and workflow  

---

### ✅ 5. Identifying Assumptions & Limitations  
We critically evaluate:
- Data assumptions  
- Bias and missing data  
- Unanswered questions  
- Areas for improvement  

This encourages critical thinking and better collaboration.

---

### ✅ 6. Contribution Readiness  
This milestone prepares us to:
- Contribute without disrupting workflows  
- Extend analysis rather than duplicate work  
- Improve documentation  
- Ask meaningful questions during reviews  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The project uses open air quality datasets including:
- PM2.5 and PM10  
- NO₂, SO₂, CO  
- AQI  
- Date and location  

Sources include government and environmental agencies.

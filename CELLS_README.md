# Understanding Notebook Cells: Code vs Markdown

This folder contains `Cells_Code_vs_Markdown.ipynb`, a short demonstration notebook for the milestone "Understanding Notebook Cells: Code vs Markdown".

What to do:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook from the project folder (see `JUPYTER_README.md` for launch steps).

2. Open `Cells_Code_vs_Markdown.ipynb`.

3. Run the Code cells (Cell 4 and 6) to see the outputs.

4. Create a new cell, convert it to Markdown, add a heading, and render it (press `M` in command mode).

5. Convert a Markdown cell back to Code (press `Y`) and run it if it contains code.

6. Record a ~2-minute screen-capture video showing: launch, opening the notebook, running a Code cell, creating/rendering a Markdown cell, switching a cell type, and explaining when to use each.

Submission:
- Upload your video per your assignment instructions or create a Pull Request with the video link and mention this README and the notebook.

If you want, I can:
- Execute the notebook here and save an executed copy, or
- Draft a 2-minute narration script for recording the video.
